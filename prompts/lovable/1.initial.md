[Logo and Banner Images]

You are a professional AI web designer. Build a clean, modern, and intuitive **landing page** for a podcast brand called **AI Pulse Georgia**. This podcast explores AI trends, innovation, and people shaping the future of AI in Georgia and beyond.

Use the uploaded logo and banner as the key visual assets. Extract and follow the brand color palette from the image: **cyan (#00CFFF), violet-purple (#A84ADB), and dark navy (#0B0F1C)**.

**Design Goals:**

- Clean, futuristic, and accessible layout.
- Hero section should feature the banner or logo prominently.
- Include sections for:

  1. About the Podcast
  2. Latest Episodes (Embed YouTube or Podcast player)
  3. Meet the Host(s)
  4. Subscribe (Spotify, Apple, YouTube, RSS)
  5. Contact / Social Links

**Design Notes:**

- Typography should feel tech-forward but readable.
- Use subtle animations or pulse effects inspired by the "Pulse" wave in the logo.
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive design.
- Backgrounds should be dark with light text to match the high-tech visual theme.

**Functionality:**

- Use embedded YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/@AIPulseGeorgia](https://www.youtube.com/@AIPulseGeorgia) for recent episodes.
- Include a call-to-action: "Subscribe & Stay Updated on Georgiaâ€™s AI Future."
